# Sorting-Visualizer

This is the first project that I built related to alogorithms!

This project uses a version of the bubble sort method to sort each individual bar in ascending order by height.

Click on the 'initialize' button to randomize the order of the bars and click on the 'play' button to sort them!

It is a myth that if you want to be a front end developer then you don't need to worry about algorithms! They are important for further developing your coding and
critical thinking skills!

This is a solid, beginner-friendly project to get you introduced to algorithms. Enjoy!
